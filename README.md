## Brief Description
This was the final project done by me for my MAKE Course at my University. It was a 3D printed half of a guiar neck with 5 frets that had LEDs on each fret position for each string and would light up at the desginated position to show one how to play guitar chords and scales. And IR remote and LCD screen were also incorporated to guide the user. Since this was a prototype, it only had a few settings. This was also my first time using an Arduino or Microcontroller. This project uses C++.
